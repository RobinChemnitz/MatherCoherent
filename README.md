# MatherCoherent
The code of the numerical implementation of the methods described in the paper titled 'Extracting coherent sets in aperiodically driven flows from generators of Mather semigroups' by Robin Chemnitz, Maximilian Engel and PÃ©ter Koltai. 

To simulate one of the examples given in the paper, run on the the scripts ExampleX.m to load the respective example, then execute main.m. To run a new example, create copy one of the ExampleX.m scripts and edit the parameters. The output figures and videos of a simulation can be found in a folder with the name of the respective example and the method used to compute the coherent sets, e.g. Oscillating Gyres/abs/. The three methods are named (CS1):'positive', (CS2):'real', (CS3):'abs'.
